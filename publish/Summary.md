# Knobby

Knobby is an extension for Xbox and PS4 controller sticks.


## Choices

- **Height added:** The mm indications in the filenames tell you, how many millimeters the extension
  adds on top of the stick. It really depends on your hands, games and gaming style,
  how much height you want to add. **The 8 mm Knobby is a good start.**


- **Top Grip Pattern:** Choose between three top grip patterns:
    - **Without:** Just a plain dome style top. No measures to add grip. Feels
      very slick and comfy. Works great for arcade gaming, or if you use the
      controller for other applications than games. In racing or FPS games
      where exact moves are important, better choose one of the two gripped tops.
    - **Circular:** It adds some grip to the whole top, without being too accentuated
      all around. That's my personal favorite for racing games.
    - **Sausage:** It adds grip around the tip of the top. The "sausages" stick
      out a bit, so you're really not gonna slip of the stick when you move your
      fingertip towards the center, even if you move your fingers really fast.


- **Top Grip Weight:** The "Circular" and "Sausage" versions have two different
  grip weights:
    - **Light:** The pattern is light and doesn't protrude that much from the dome.
    - **Bold:** The pattern is stronger, more accentuated.


## Printing

No supports needed. The bridging distances needed are very short, even bad
printers should handle it well enough.

Just drop the STL in your slicer, and go with the usual standard settings,
like 0.2 mm layer height and 20% infill. The top grips already work very well
with this grade of detail. If you can spare some more minutes, do it in
0.10 mm - 0.12 mm layer height, then the top grips will be a bit more detailed.


## Assembly

Just take it off the printer and stick it onto the controller sticks. They are
a really tight fit, you don't want them to come off during a game. If they are
too tight, scale them slightly in your slicer, to e.g., 103% or 105%. You could
also file or cut off a little bit off on the inside of the bottom wall.


## Modify, customize, remix!

The OpenSCAD source files are attached as well in `Knobby Sources.zip`. Feel
free to modify, customize or remix. The height addition is a customizable
parameter. To modify some more parameters, look at the `Knobby Variables.scad`.

If you own another controller, like a PS5 Dualshock, feel free to remix it,
or just tell me the diameter of the knob on the stick in the comments, then
I'll happily add a PS5 version.
